First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships."
