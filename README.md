<font face="Arial" size="3" color="black">This repository pertains to the Machine Learning course organized by <font face="Arial Black" size="4" color="black"><u>[__Dice Analytics__.](https://diceanalytics.pk/)

<font face="Arial" size="3" color="black">The course is structured in such a way that every weekend, we continually revisited various Machine Learning algorithms and apply them through different <u>[__projects__](https://github.com/Sanaullah-nahk/Dice_Analytics_ML/tree/main/Assignments)</u> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="black">*(outlined below)* <font face="Arial" size="3" color="black">on a biweekly basis.

  - <font face="Arial Black" size="4" color="blue"><u>[__Customer Segments.__](https://github.com/Sanaullah-nahk/Dice_Analytics_ML/blob/main/Assignments/Customer%20Segementation/customer_segments_tasks.ipynb)
> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="black">The project aimed to identify the different types of customers that the distributor interacts with and the variation in their spending behavior. This information could help the distributor better tailor its product offerings to different customer segments and improve its overall business performance. By applying Machine Learning algorithms to the customer spending data, we were able to identify key customer segments and their unique spending patterns, providing valuable insights into how the distributor could optimize its operations.

  - <font face="Arial Black" size="4" color="blue"><u>[__The Human Resource Analysis.__](https://github.com/Sanaullah-nahk/Dice_Analytics_ML/blob/main/Assignments/HR%20Churn%20Prediction%20Project-2/HR%20Prediction-Tasks.ipynb)
> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="black">The Human Resource Analysis project aimed to identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover, and to develop a model that could predict whether an employee was likely to leave the company or not. By analyzing various data points such as employee demographics, performance metrics, and job satisfaction ratings, the project aimed to uncover the drivers behind employee turnover and develop a model that could accurately predict which employees were most likely to leave the company. The insights gained from this project could help organizations proactively identify and address the underlying causes of employee turnover, leading to higher employee satisfaction and retention.

  - <font face="Arial Black" size="4" color="blue"><u>[__Tickets Price prediction.__](https://github.com/Sanaullah-nahk/Dice_Analytics_ML/blob/main/Assignments/Price%20Prediction%20project%20-regression/Price%20Prediction%20project%20-regression.ipynb)
> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="black">By leveraging Machine Learning algorithms and regression techniques, the project aimed to build a predictive model that could accurately predict future ticket prices. The system provided users with real-time information about ticket prices and their anticipated changes, enabling them to make informed decisions about ticket purchases. Additionally, the project aimed to identify the key drivers of ticket pricing, such as train service, time of day, or destination, which could help inform pricing and marketing strategies for train companies.
